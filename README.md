## ▶️ Behavior Overview

### 🔁 Repeat
When `repeat` is enabled, the timer automatically restarts after each interval and continues indefinitely (unless paused or reset).

### ⏸ Pause / Resume
When `pause` is enabled:
- The current interval is paused.
- The remaining time is stored and used when resumed.

When `pause` is disabled again:
- The timer resumes using the stored remaining time.

### 🔄 Reset
When `reset` is enabled:
- Any active timer is cleared immediately.
- A new interval does **not** start automatically. You must trigger it again (e.g., via component re-render or external trigger).
